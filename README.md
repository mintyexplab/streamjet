# StreamJet Radio
StreamJet is a simple radio app for Windows which includes a certain amount of radio stations for you to pick. We constantly update the stations that we add so feel free to send requests! Each version of StreamJet (Windows) will always have the same amount of radio stations no matter what. Whether you're on 1.0 or 1.2.1, you'll have the same stations!



Access the site! (work in progess, will be finished by late dec-early jan.)

NOTE: for versions before 1.2. Move StreamJet to your preferred directory BEFORE running the software. The app will not open if you move it
