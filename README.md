# StreamJet Radio
StreamJet is a simple radio app for Windows which includes a certain amount of radio stations for you to pick. We constantly update the stations that we add so feel free to send requests! Each version of StreamJet (Windows) will always have the same amount of radio stations no matter what. Whether you're on 1.0 or 1.2.1, you'll have the same stations!

In terms of the license, i'm gonna be pretty restrictive with it. If you want to change up my service and ship it off as your own. Abide by the terms of the license I have applied to StreamJet, also please make significant changes to it so it doesn't look like a clone of StreamJet. I won't take legal action but I will tell you to takedown your project if it gets bad.
