# StreamJet Web Platform
This is the branch for the Web Platform version of the StreamJet site. This can be run standalone as I have included the necessary files in this branch however you can merge it with the main branch in order to have the completed StreamJet site.

In terms of the license, I'm gonna be pretty restrictive with it. If you want to change up my service and ship it off as your own. Abide by the terms of the license I have applied to StreamJet, also please make significant changes to it so it doesn't look like a clone of StreamJet. I won't take legal action but I will tell you to takedown your project if it gets bad.
