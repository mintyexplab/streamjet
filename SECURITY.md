## Reporting a Vulnerability

Usually StreamJet shouldn't have security vulnerabilities as it doesn't have an account system or anything like that. If you have noticed a vulnerability, please contact us through the contact page on the StreamJet website or contact the email (mintylab@bsdmail.com) listed on our organization home page.
