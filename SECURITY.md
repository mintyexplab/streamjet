# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The versions of StreamJet (Desktop, Web, and Mobile) that have a checkmark are currently supported by minty's experiment lab. The ones with an X are not. 1.2.x will stay in supported status until StreamJet Desktop 1.4.x (if I manage to keep developing StreamJet) but for now, it's still supported and still is the latest version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Desktop 1.3.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| Desktop 1.2.x  | :white_check_mark: |
| Mobile 1.0  | :white_check_mark: |
| 1.1.8 (Web)   | :white_check_mark: |
| Desktop 1.1.x   | :x:                |
| Desktop PRE 1.0.x   | :x:                |


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Usually StreamJet shouldn't have security vulnerabilities as it doesn't have an account system or anything like that. If you have noticed a vulnerability, please contact us through the contact page on the StreamJet website or contact the email (mintylab@bsdmail.com) listed on our organization home page.
